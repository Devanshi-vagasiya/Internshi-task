# Internship Project - UI/UX Design Tasks

This repository contains the internship tasks assigned to me, focusing on UI/UX design principles, usability, and modern interface development.  
Each task explores different aspects of design such as redesigning existing interfaces, creating user flows, building UI kits, and conducting heuristic evaluations.
